james twitterbot

A twitterbot I created to share pictures of my dog James...referred by my family as "The James".  His twitter account is @TheDogTheJames.  

Currently, it responds to mentions with the hashtags #POD, #JamesForAll, and #AllHailTheJames with a randomly selected image.

These images are from one of several iPhones in my family, so the heic files need to be converted to jpg using python library PyHeif.  

I currently have the program hosted on pythonanywhere.com (paid account for always on task)

I'll update this more as I add more features.
